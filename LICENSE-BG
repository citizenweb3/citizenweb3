1. Do whatever you like with the original work. Just make sure not to be a bad person.

Being a bad person includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY not being a good person.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a very bad person.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a bad person would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) something nice.

3. Code and/or audio materials and/or visual instances are provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and/or audio materials and/or visual instances 
(including the logo) and bitching if it all went wrong makes you a bad person. Fix the problem yourself. A good person would submit the fix back.
