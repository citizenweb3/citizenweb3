# Citizen Cosmos community episodes

## TL;DR

The general idea is to create an ongoing, occasional, interactive episode with active community members. The episode should be interactively promoted, meaning that the discussed topics, questions asked, etc, are highly dependent on previous interactions with active community members and their wishes. Such episodes will reward listeners with ATOM via an easy gamified process.

## Episode flow

- The episode are bound to any known public occasion (i.e. Cosmos anniversary, Xmas, etc)
- The episode is hosted by the community advocate and co-hosted by the usual hosts
- The episode invites 2-3 community guests
- The topic of the episode (apart from the pilot) is polled via CC TG channel and Twitter
- Questions to guests are suggested by the community
- In the future, a DAO is used for voting on guests, topics, questions, dates of the episode
- At the end of the episode, CC will provide a social task. This is most likely a twit that has to contain a certain tag and certain content (announced on the episode)
- All participants that completed the task within the designated amount of time, receive a reward from the CC validator in ATOM

## Episode roadmap

- Pilot recorded and released by Xmas
- Plan dates to bound episodes to
